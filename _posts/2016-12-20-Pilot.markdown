It's been a while that I've been entertaining the idea of establishing an event for the cyber security folks here at NYU Abu Dhabi. So... The idea goes more or less like this: Every (Cyber)Monday at 5pm, we get together in the Twinlab conference room (comfy couches) and watch a video presentation from a top security conference (DEFCON, BlackHat, CCS,  etc.) and then chat about it. Couches, popcorn, hacks, what more can you ask?
