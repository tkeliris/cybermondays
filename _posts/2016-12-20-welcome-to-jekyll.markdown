It's been a while that I've been entertaining the idea of establishing an event for the cyber security folks here at NYU Abu Dhabi. So... The idea goes more or less like this: Every Monday at 5pm, we get together in the Twinlab conference room (comfy couches) and watch a video presentation from a top security conference (DEFCON, BlackHat, CCS,  etc.) and then chat about it. Couches, popcorn, hacks, what more can you ask?

If you liked what you read be on the lookout for another post with info for the first event, which I guess has to be in 2017.
