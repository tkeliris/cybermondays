In the [Pilot]({% post_url 2016-12-20-Pilot %}) post I introduced the concept of CyberMondays for NYUAD. Now it's time to make it a reality. I feel it is appropriate that the first video is by good-ol-fashioned Zoz. For Monday Feb. 13, 2017 we'll watch a DEFCON video and see what happens when you steal a hacker's computer (funny things happen)!

Disclaimer: The security community can be a bit weird and vulgar at times, but hey don't shoot the messenger!
