We are a big group and we are growing and it’s nice to do some group bonding. In fact we are growing so much that they’ll kick us out of the building and take us across the street! Meh, it’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… The idea I have in mind goes like this: Every Monday at 4pm, we get together in the Twinlab conference room (comfy couches) and watch a video presentation from a top security conference (DEFCON, BlackHat etc.) and then chat about it. Couches, popcorn, hacks, what more can you ask? Hope this kicks off and I would be happy to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tasos&lt;/p&gt;
