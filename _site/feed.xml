&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:
Cache attacks have proven to be a big concern for security code designers because they are able to recover a wide range of information, ranging from cryptographic keys to user privacy-related information. These attacks take advantage of the fact that two processes are utilizing the same hardware resource, thus leveraging unexpected leakages that can be exploited by a malicious user. More specifically, Last Level Cache (LLC) attacks make use of the fact that the LLC is shared across cores, thus being able to steal information from users located in different cores. These attacks have been shown to be applicable in a wide variety of scenarios, going from IaaS clouds to web browsing exploitation with embedded javascript code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation describes three most dangerous cache attacks follow, i.e., Flush + Reload, Evict + Reload and Prime + Probe. Indeed their characteristics also determine their applicability; while Flush + Reload and Evict + Reload requires memory deduplication to succeed (i.e. shared memory between processes), Prime + Probe does not need special requirements to succeed. We evaluate the different examples of everyday usage software that can be targeted by this kind of attacks to violate our privacy. Further, this presentation expands on the scenarios in which each of the attacks succeed - including but not limited to, IaaS and PaaS co-located VMs/processes, web browsing javascript attacks, smartphone inter-application attacks, and trusted execution environment attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this presentation explores the mitigation of such attacks: at the software level (writing secret independent execution flow), at the OS/hypervisor level (Utilizing LLC isolation through mechanisms like page sharing) and at the system level (e.g., locking certain portions of the LLC or behavior detection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A processor is not a trusted black box for running code; on the contrary, modern x86 chips are packed full of secret instructions and hardware bugs. In this talk, we’ll demonstrate how page fault analysis and some creative processor fuzzing can be used to exhaustively search the x86 instruction set and uncover the secrets buried in your chipset. We’ll disclose new x86 hardware glitches, previously unknown machine instructions, ubiquitous software bugs, and flaws in enterprise hypervisors. Best of all, we’ll release our sandsifter toolset, so that you can audit - and break - your own processor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electricity is of paramount importance in our everyday lives. Our dependence on it is particularly evident during even brief power outages. You can think of power systems as the backbone of critical infrastructures. To date, cyber-attacks against power systems are considered to be extremely sophisticated and only within the reach of nation-states. However, through this presentation we will challenge this perception, and provide a structured methodology towards attacking a power system on a limited budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When gathering information during the design phase of an attack, it is electrifying what you can find on the internet if you know what to look for. We will demonstrate information obtained from the web that can be leveraged to model and analyze a target power system, and how we can use this information to model power systems throughout the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this talk is not just about theory. We will demonstrate a critical vulnerability we discovered in General Electric Multilin products widely deployed in power systems. Essentially, we completely broke the home brew encryption algorithm used by these protection and management devices to authenticate users and allow privileged operations. Knowledge of the passcode enables an attacker to completely pwn the device and disconnect sectors of the power grid at will, locking operators out to prolong the attack. We will also show a technique for remotely fingerprinting affected devices over the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk includes a live demo showcasing exploitation of the vulnerability on a feeder management relay and how this vulnerability can have significant impact on a nation. We will discuss mitigation strategies, including the specific firmware update that addresses this vulnerability, and provide our thoughts on what the next steps in securing the power infrastructure should be. Tune in for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WASHINGTON, DC:&lt;/strong&gt; For years, the government and security experts have warned of the looming threat of “cyberwar” against critical infrastructure in the US and elsewhere. Predictions of cyber attacks wreaking havoc on power grids, financial systems, and other fundamental parts of nations’ fabric have been foretold repeatedly over the past two decades, and each round has become more dire. The US Department of Energy declared in its Quadrennial Energy Review, just released this month, that the electrical grid in the US “faces imminent danger from a cyber attack.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, however, the damage done by cyber attacks, both real (Stuxnet’s destruction of Iranian uranium enrichment centrifuges and a few brief power outages alleged to have been caused by Russian hackers using BlackEnergy malware) and imagined or exaggerated (the Iranian “attack” on a broken flood control dam in Rye, New York), cannot begin to measure up to an even more significant cyber-threat—squirrels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the presentation titled “35 Years of Cyberwar: The Squirrels Are Winning”, SpaceRogue revealed the scale of the squirrelly threat to worldwide critical infrastructure by presenting data gathered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cybersquirrel1.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CyberSquirrel 1&lt;/a&gt;, a project that gathers information on animal-induced infrastructure outages collected from sources on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In IT security, offensive problems are technical - but most defensive problems are political and organisational. Attackers have the luxury to focus only on the technical aspects of their work, while defenders have to navigate complex political and regulatory environments. In a previous talk (“Rearchitecting a defendable internet”) I discussed what technical measures would yield defendable devices - and intentionally omitted the political and economics side. This talk, on the other hand, will explore the economics and incentive structures in IT security: Who is incentivized by who to do what - and how these incentives fail to produce the security level we desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will look at different players in IT security: CISOs, security product vendors, computer manufacturers, cyber insurances - and examine their economic incentive structures, their interplay, and reasons for failure. The talk will also discuss an alternate reality where things work smoothly, and examine the differences to our current reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your precious 0-day? That meticulously crafted exploit? The perfect foothold? At some point, they’ll be captured, dissected, and put on display. Reverse engineers. When they begin snooping through your hard work, it pays to have planned out your defense ahead of time. You can take the traditional defensive route - encryption, obfuscation, anti-debugging - or you can go on the offense, and attack the heart and soul of anyone who dare look at your perfect code. With some carefully crafted assembly, we’ll show how to break down a reverse engineer by sending them misleading, intimidating, and demoralizing messages through the control flow graphs of their favorite RE tools - turning their beloved IDA (Hopper, BinNavi, Radare, etc) into unwitting weapons for devastating psychological warfare in reverse engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last years, mobile devices and smartphones have become the most important personal computing platform. Besides phone calls and managing the personal address book, they are also used to approve bank transfers and digitally sign official documents, thus storing very sensitive secrets. Their exposure or misappropriation would not only be a fatal infringement of privacy, but could also lead to disastrous consequences in terms of financial security and identity theft. So what if it is possible to silently monitor and track what the user is doing on his smartphone or recovering encryption keys without any permissions or privileges?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we will show that all of this is possible by mounting cache side-channel attacks on ARM that have been believed to work solely on x86 architecture. We will discuss how we overcame the challenges to perform such attacks on smartphones and demonstrate their immense attack potential. We prepared a live demo to show an unprivileged app that records the exact timestamps of user input activity. We will also present how two apps on a system can communicate with each other, circumventing the permission system and show how we can attack Bouncy Castles AES implementation. We will release source code that allows the user to perform platform-independent attacks within minutes. It serves as a starting point for research on cache side-channel attacks on smartphones and a foundation to build more sophisticated attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2013 and 2014 several high profile vulnerabilities were found in Belkin’s WeMo line of home automation devices. Belkin not only patched most of those vulnerabilities, but also maintains a very regular update cycle, which makes them one of the more responsive players in the IoT space. Therefore, we thought it would be interesting to revisit this line of IoT products to see how we could break or abuse them. What we found are multiple vulnerabilities in both the device and the Android app that can be used to obtain a root shell on the device, run arbitrary code on the phone paired with the device, deny service to the device, and launch DoS attacks without rooting the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk will walk through the details of heap overflow, SQL injection, and code injection zero days, as well as their associated exploits. We will also introduces a new technique for achieving code execution via SQL injection into a SQLite database on an embedded device. The talk will conclude with demonstrations of rooting a WeMo device and injecting code into the WeMo Android app from a WeMo device. That’s right, we will show you how to make your IoT hack your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cryptocurrencies” refer to techniques for purely digital currencies. The most famous of these is Bitcoin, but since its creation numerous other currencies have also been created, relying on the underlying Distributed Ledger Technology to create a publicly verifiable list of transactions: the blockchain. There is considerable interest from the data science community, the financial sector and government in other applications of this technology, and other instantiations of cryptocurrencies that may offer different levels of anonymity, untraceability and verifiability. In this talk IOHK’s chief scientist Aggelos Kiayias presents &lt;a href=&quot;https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Secure Decentralized Blockchains without Proofs of Work”&lt;/a&gt; at the Alan Turning Institute in London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IoT has been in the news for the wrong reasons, with poorly designed and managed IoT devices being blamed for contribiting to denial of service attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presentation covers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Risks to your own business from IoT takeup and how to avoid them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to be a good citizen by ensuring your devices are not a risk to others&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to run your own IoT control and monitoring hub in the cloud, and to coerce incompatible devices into working together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Points to consider when selecting IoT products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IoT is immature - many devices are not as secure as they could be.
I cover how to structure your network in order to reduce the attack surface presented by your devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IoT is faceless, many devices are unobtrusive and you may not notice if they “go rogue”. I offer advice on how to establish a management regime to limit the damage a misbehaving device can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IoT is fragmented, everyone is scrabbling to be the market leader, so many products do not work well together. This means each device may want to talk to its own cloud service. I cover how to bridge uncooperative products to narrow or eliminate need for direct internet access, and offer advice on strategies to build a cooperating whole.&lt;/p&gt;
